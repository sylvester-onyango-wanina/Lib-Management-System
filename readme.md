# Library Management System

## Description
This project implements a simple **Library Management System** using MySQL. It manages books, library members, and the checkout system. The database structure is normalized to ensure data integrity and avoid redundancy.

### Features:
- **Books table:** Stores information about books including title, author, ISBN, and quantity.
- **Members table:** Contains details of library members.
- **Checkouts table:** Tracks the books borrowed by members and their due dates.
  
## How to Run the Project

### Setup:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Library-Management-System.git
   cd Library-Management-System
mysql -u username -p < library_management.sql
SELECT 
    m.FirstName, 
    m.LastName, 
    b.Title AS BookTitle, 
    c.CheckoutDate, 
    c.ReturnDate
FROM Checkouts c
JOIN Members m ON c.MemberID = m.MemberID
JOIN Books b ON c.BookID = b.BookID;


If you have an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) image or a link, you can add it under the "ERD" section in the `README.md`.

#### 5. Add, Commit, and Push the Changes

Now that you have both your `.sql` file and `README.md`, let's add, commit, and push your changes to GitHub:

```bash
git add library_management.sql README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add Library Management System SQL schema and README"
git push origin main
